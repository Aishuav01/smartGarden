# smartGarden

We wanted to start gardening. but we knew we wouldn't keep up the regular schedule of
watering the plants and making sure that they remain healthy. So, we recruited a
micro-controller and suite of sensors to help with this tasks. Watering plants is the most
important cultural practice and most labor intensive task in daily gardening operation
Watering systems case the burden of getting plants when they nced it. Knowing when to and how much to water is two important aspects of watering process.Smart Garden
is a plant environmental monitoring system. It monitors the soil moisture, air temperature
and air humidity of your plant(s) and automatically waters the plant based on the data
reccived by sensors. The user only rquires to plug in the system and the plants will be
watered with respect to the soil moisture, weather temperature , humidity and air quality.
